Facemask Detection
Overview
Facemask Detection is an AI-based project designed to identify whether individuals are wearing face masks properly. This system uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect faces in real-time and classify them as masked, unmasked, or improperly masked. Such a solution is particularly useful in enforcing health protocols in public places, workplaces, or any crowded environment.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Detects facemask usage in live camera feeds or pre-recorded video footage.
High Accuracy: Trained using diverse datasets to ensure reliability across different lighting and environmental conditions.
Multi-Class Classification: Classifies faces into categories such as masked, unmasked, or improperly masked.
Easy Integration: Can be integrated with existing surveillance systems or standalone devices.
Visual Alerts: Provides visual cues for non-compliance.
Applications
Public Health: Enforces health protocols in crowded areas like airports, malls, and public transport.
Workplace Safety: Monitors compliance in offices, factories, and warehouses.
Education: Ensures mask usage in schools and universities.
Event Management: Controls mask compliance at large gatherings or events.
How It Works
Face Detection: Uses a deep learning model to identify and locate faces in images or video frames.
Mask Classification: Applies a trained classifier to determine the mask status (masked, unmasked, improperly masked).
Alert Mechanism: Triggers visual or audible alerts for unmasked individuals.
Technologies Used
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Object Detection Models: YOLO, SSD, or Haar Cascades.
Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV.
Dataset: Trained on large, publicly available facemask datasets to ensure diverse representation.
Future Enhancements
Mask Color and Type Detection: Identify specific types of masks (e.g., N95, cloth, surgical).
Crowd Analytics: Generate statistical reports on mask compliance in large gatherings.
Integration with IoT: Build hardware devices for automatic mask detection.
