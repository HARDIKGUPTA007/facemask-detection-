**Facemask Detection**

Overview


   Facemask Detection is an AI-based project designed to identify whether individuals are wearing face masks properly. This system uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect faces in real-time 
   and classify them as masked, unmasked, or improperly masked. Such a solution is particularly useful in enforcing health protocols in public places, workplaces, or any crowded environment.


**Features**

 1. Real-Time Detection: Detects facemask usage in live camera feeds or pre-recorded video footage.
 2.High Accuracy: Trained using diverse datasets to ensure reliability across different lighting and environmental conditions.
 3.Multi-Class Classification: Classifies faces into categories such as masked, unmasked, or improperly masked.
 4.Easy Integration: Can be integrated with existing surveillance systems or standalone devices.
 5.Visual Alerts: Provides visual cues for non-compliance.


**Applications**
 1.Public Health: Enforces health protocols in crowded areas like airports, malls, and public transport.
 2.Workplace Safety: Monitors compliance in offices, factories, and warehouses.
 3.Education: Ensures mask usage in schools and universities.
 4.Event Management: Controls mask compliance at large gatherings or events.

 
 
**How It Works**
 1.Face Detection: Uses a deep learning model to identify and locate faces in images or video frames.
 2.Mask Classification: Applies a trained classifier to determine the mask status (masked, unmasked, improperly masked).
 3.Alert Mechanism: Triggers visual or audible alerts for unmasked individuals.

 
**Technologies Used**
 1.Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
 2.Object Detection Models: YOLO, SSD, or Haar Cascades.
 3.Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV.
 4.Dataset: Trained on large, publicly available facemask datasets to ensure diverse representation.

 
 
**Future Enhancements** 
 1.Mask Color and Type Detection: Identify specific types of masks (e.g., N95, cloth, surgical).
 2.Crowd Analytics: Generate statistical reports on mask compliance in large gatherings.
 3.Integration with IoT: Build hardware devices for automatic mask detection.
